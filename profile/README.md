**Nebula** is an ambitious, unified ecosystem aiming to build a global decentralized platform. We are rebuilding the web from the ground up—**without external libraries**. Every component, from the cryptographic primitives to the browser engine, is forged in-house to ensure absolute sovereignty, security, and performance.

---

## 🛠️ The "Zero-Library" Mandate

In this organization, we follow a strict development philosophy: **Total Independence.** * **No Third-Party Crates:** We do not use external frameworks or utility libraries. 
* **Built from Scratch:** We reimplement protocols (Kademlia), engines (HTML/CSS/JS), and databases (B-Trees) ourselves.
* **Fully Auditable Stack:** By removing the "black box" of dependencies, we provide a 100% transparent and secure environment.
* **Hardware-Level Control:** Using our custom **Cadentis** and **Cryptal** units, we optimize every CPU cycle specifically for Nebula.

---

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

Nebula is developed as a single, cohesive universe. All repositories are open and accessible to the community.

### **Core Infrastructure**
* **Kadnet:** Our decentralized P2P networking layer based on the Kademlia protocol.
* **CosmaDB:** A distributed storage engine built on custom data structures and scalable indexing.
* **NebulisChain:** The economic, incentive, and governance layer of the network.

### **User Experience**
* **Starship:** The native decentralized browser. It includes our custom-built rendering, CSS, and scripting engines.
* **App Store:** A sovereign platform for privacy-respecting, open-source applications built specifically for Nebula.

## 📄 License Philosophy

Nebula is licensed under the **Server Side Public License (SSPL) v1**.

This license is intentionally chosen to protect the integrity of the Nebula ecosystem.  
While the project is fully open for **contribution, improvement, and transparency**,  
SSPL prevents third parties from creating competing platforms, proprietary versions,  
or commercial services derived from the project.

Nebula is designed to grow as **one unified, community-driven network**.  
By using SSPL, we ensure that:

- All improvements remain open and benefit the ecosystem.
- The network does not fragment into multiple incompatible forks.
- Companies cannot exploit the project without contributing back.
- Contributors retain full access to the entire codebase.

In short, SSPL ensures that Starship — and the Nebula ecosystem built on top of it — remains **open to the community, but protected from fragmentation and exploitation**.

## 🦀 Technical Stack

- **Primary Language**: Rust 1.92.0
- **Standard Library Only**: We rely exclusively on the Rust standard library, avoiding the dependency bloat of the external crates ecosystem.

## 🤝 Contact & Community

We are looking for developers who aren't afraid to "reinvent the wheel" to make it better, faster, and more secure.
